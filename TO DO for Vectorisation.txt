TO DO FOR VECTORISATION

Noise_functions: 
        Perlin generator 
            DONE, INCOMPATIBLE WITH OLD
                sample, 
                        DONE, UNCHECKED
                get_height, 
                        Done, channel select changed
                pattern
                        DONE, incompatible with for loop method?
                base_sample,
                        DONE, CHECKED

landscape:
        get_height should work for vectorised (check) as long as mountains are False
        get_base_height 
                needs to work with vectorisation
                Confirm which distance for centroids is used
                Calculate centroid distance in vectorised way (???)
                significant rewrite of functional steps needed

imaging_functions:
        add option for vectorised version of show_map_3D (easy)
